What is Deployment?
=======================

According to Wikipedia:

   *"Software deployment is all of the activities that make a software system 
   available for use."*

In web development, this usually means:

*  Creating a server that is accessible to all of the users of the software
   - Consider whether the software should be accessible publicly on the 
   internet, on an intranet or other network
   - The server which hosts the code that is used by the end-user is 
   commonly known as the "production" server.
*  Moving the application code to this server
