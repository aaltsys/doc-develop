AAltsys Web Developer Guides
=============================

"A poor workman blames his tools," it has been said. An unskilled workman, 
on the other hand, doesn't know what tools are, where to get them, or how to 
use them. That's why these guides are here.

AAltsys Technology offers these guides to those who think that developer tools 
are unavailable, costly, or too hard to use. The fact is that software 
development tools are freely available on-line, and becoming a developer is an 
easy process for those who are willing to invest the time to learn.
