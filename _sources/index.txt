AAltsys Web Developer Guides
=============================

"A poor workman blames his tools," it has been said. An inexperienced workman, 
on the other hand, doesn't know what tools are, where to get them, or how to 
use them. That's why these guides are here.

AAltsys Technology offers these guides to challenge the thinking that tools for
software development must be proprietary, costly, or too hard to use. In the 
world of open source software, high quality development tools are available 
on-line, and becoming a developer is an easy process for those who are willing 
to invest the time to learn.
