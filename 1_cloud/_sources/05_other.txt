.. note:: The cloud service accounts installed perviously will be used right 
   away. This article describes additional services which will be used somewhat 
   later, and which are not required for the basic exercises to follow.

Dropbox and Google Documents
=============================

Some project information does not fit in nicely with the text documents that 
software developers write. Graphic images, video, and drawing or design files 
might be used in a project by the design team. Software developers need access 
to these files, even though these data are usually not stored in a repository,
and file sharing services answer this need.

(Instructions to be added later.)

Asana Project Management
=============================

Project management is an important aspect of collaborative development,
especially regarding client input and relationships. Setup an Asana account to 
track development issues and progress.
