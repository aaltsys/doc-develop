Shells
=====================
 
 A shell, to put it simply, is a bash terminal. When you open the terminal, You're running a shell. As stated previously, bash stands for Bourne Again Shell, so bash itself is a shell
 
Subshells

 A subshell occurs when a shell script(A script ending in .sh) is run from a bash terminal. for instance, if you run a script called Subshell.sh then it's a Subshell. Anything run out of that terminal is a subshell of that terminal.
