What is Bash?
=============================

Bash is, to put it simply, a shell. In fact, Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell.
Bash is a type of shell which is widely supported and can be found on nearly every linux system.
Bash is in fact a command processor, meaning that it is the language of the linux terminal. Bash was origianally written by Brian Fox in 1988, and it is still in use today, 26 years later.
However, bash is indeed a programming language, or, as some call it, a shell-scripting language.
It has many  similarities to other programming languages. it has Variables, Logic statements, and functions.
