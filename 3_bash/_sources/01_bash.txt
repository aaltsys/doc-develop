What is Bash
=============================

Bash is, to put it simply, a shell. In fact, Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell.
Bash is a type of shell which is widely supported and can be found on nearly every linux system.
However, keep in mind that bash is a programming language, just like any other.
It uses the same rules any other programming language does. it has Variables, Logic statements, and the like.
