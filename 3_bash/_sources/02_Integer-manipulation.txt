Bash operational signs.
===========================

Bash has 6 main operational signs ::

    + Addition
    - Subtraction
    / Division
    * Multiplication
    ** Exponentation
    % Modulo
    
They probably all seem familiar except for those last two, Exponentation and Modulo.
Exponentation is when a number is raised to that power, so 12**3 is 12*12*12
Modulo is the remainder when a Division is finished, so 13%3 is 1.

Simple Mathematical operations
================================

So, you open the terminal, type 7 + 4, and out comes 11, right? Unfortunately not. Instead you'll get "7: command not found"
Bash doesn't do math quite like your average programming language like ruby or python or javascript. but it does have alternate methods which you can use.

In the Terminal
==================
There are several different ways of performing math in a command line. one is to define each variable as a number. for instance:

Three=3
Seven=7
Nine=4

Then in the terminal type ::

    echo $(($Three+$Nine+$Seven))

This will display the result of 3+4+7. If you should wish to do any other simple math like this simply declare a variable. Also note that bash does not use order of operations, so 2+2*2 will display as 8, not 6.

If you prefer a simpler method, you can also type: ::

   echo $[Three+Seven]
   
Which will return the value of 10

The Let Command
======================

.. sidebar ::

    An example of the let command ::
    
        let x=5
        echo $x
        5
        let x=$x+2
        echo $x
        7

The let command is a built in Bash command which is useful for integer Manipulation.
If you look at the sidebar you'll probably think: "How is this different from the normal terminal?" well, in a couple ways.
first, if you define x and then redefine it as itself plus 2 without let, it will echo $x+2 when called.
however, the let command can even further simplify numerical operations. instead of typing ::

    let x=$x+$x
    
You can simply write ::    

    let x=x+x
    
and the result will be 14.
