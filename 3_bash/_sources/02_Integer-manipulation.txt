Simple Mathematical operations
================================

So, you open the terminal, type 7 + 4, and out comes 11, right? Unfortunately not. Instead you'll get "7: command not found"
Bash doesn't do math quite like your average programming language like ruby or python or javascript. but it does have alternate methods which you can use.

In the Terminal
==================
There are several different ways of performing math in a command line. one is to define each variable as a number. for instance:

Three=3
Seven=7
Nine=4

Then in the terminal type ::

    echo $(($Three+$Nine+$Seven))

This will display the result of 3+4+7. If you should wish to do any other simple math like this simply declare a variable. Also note that bash does not use order of operations, so 2+2*2 will display as 8, not 6.

If you prefer a simpler method, you can also type: ::

   echo $[Three+Seven]
   
Which will return the value of 10
