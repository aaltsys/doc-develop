Declared Variables
=====================

.. sidebar:: Example Declared Variable
  
  Thisvariable="A string"

Declared Variables are those which are declared within a script. an example of a declared variable is: ::

  Variable="This is a string"
  
They are usually declared at the beginning of the shell script.
then, when they're called, the value they've been given is what is used. the value can be changed at any time by re-declaring it, I.E. ::

  Variable="This is now a different string"
