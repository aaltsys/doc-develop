 Create Gmail Account

Cloud development may be performed on any computer with an effective web 
browser. This means that development may be performed on public access computers 
in school classrooms, libraries, coffee shops, or other locations. To guarantee 
privacy and security for the developer, it is necessary to have a separate 
identity for development, particularly with separate email.

The first step in cloud development is to create this new web identity, starting 
with email. Google's Gmail is an excellent web-based email service which is 
available free for individual accounts. Use the following instructions to sign 
up for a Google account and Gmail.

Get a Google  Account
=============================

.. warning:: An account application with a birth year of 1999 or later will be 
   rejected. Even worse, when using Google's Chrome browser, you will have to 
   switch to a different browser such as Firefox to enter an application once a 
   rejection occurs.
