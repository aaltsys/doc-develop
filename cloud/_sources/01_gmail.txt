 Create Gmail Account

Here are some reasons for having unsatisfactory email service: 

+  Internet Service Providers may not use effective SPAM filtering
+  Home email accounts may be shared with other users
+  Email using POP3 for delivery is not accessible on public computers
+  Email using provider POP3 accounts is not persistent
+  Mail may not persist in the cloud, so information is lost
+  Organizational coordination requires standardization of email addresses

The first step in cloud development is to have a web identity. Google's Gmail 
is an excellent email service which is available free for individual accounts. 
Use the following instructions to sign up for a Google account and Gmail.

   switch to a different browser such as Firefox to enter an application once a 
   rejection occurs.
