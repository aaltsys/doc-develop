Learn Shell Scripting
=============================

Learning computer programming is a daunting challenge. However, every Unix/Linux 
computer system has a built-in shell scripting language which is designed for 
managing the computer, and learning to program in shell scripts is not hard. 
Shell commands are interactive, and the results from commands are immediate.

The best part of learning shell scripting is, everything you learn to do well in 
shell is part of the programming skill required in any programming language. 
Shell programming is not a replacement for other programming languages, but 
it is powerful enough that Linus Torvalds used shell scripting to write the 
first versions of the :program:`git` repository.
