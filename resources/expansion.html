<h2>Command Statement Expansion<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into words.
There are seven kinds of expansion performed: brace expansion, tilde expansion,
parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion,
word splitting, and pathname expansion.</p>
<p>The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and
variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a
left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and pathname expansion.</p>
<p>On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available:
process substitution. This is performed at the same time as tilde, parameter,
variable, and arithmetic expansion and command substitution.</p>
<p>Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can change the
number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a
single word. The only exceptions to this are the expansions of &#8220;$&#64;&#8221; and
&#8220;${name[&#64;]}&#8221; as explained above (see PARAMETERS).</p>
<div class="section" id="brace-expansion">
<h3>Brace Expansion<a class="headerlink" href="#brace-expansion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.
This mechanism is similar to pathname expansion, but the filenames generated
need not exist. Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional
preamble, followed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a sequence
expression between a pair of braces, followed by an optional postscript. The
preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the
postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right.</p>
<p>Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left  to
right order is preserved.  For example, a{d,c,b}e expands into <a href="#id2"><span class="problematic" id="id3">`</span></a>ade ace abe&#8217;.</p>
<p>A  sequence  expression  takes  the form {x..y[..incr]}, where x and y are either integers or
single characters, and incr, an optional increment, is an integer.  When  integers  are
supplied,  the  expression expands to each number between x and y, inclusive.  Supplied integers
may be prefixed with 0 to force each term to have the same width.  When either x or y  begins
with  a  zero,  the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same number of
digits, zero-padding where necessary.  When characters are supplied, the  expression  expands
to  each  character lexicographically between x and y, inclusive, using the default C locale.
Note that both x and y must be of the same type.  When the increment is supplied, it is  used
as the difference between each term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.</p>
<p>Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other
expansions are preserved in the result.  It is strictly textual.  Bash  does  not  apply  any
syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.</p>
<p>A  correctly-formed  brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at
least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression.  Any incorrectly formed brace
expansion is left unchanged.  A { or , may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being
considered part of a brace expression.  To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the
string  ${ is not considered eligible for brace expansion.</p>
<p>This  construct  is  typically  used as shorthand when the common prefix of the strings to be
generated is longer than in the above example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}</div></blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>or</dt>
<dd>chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}</dd>
</dl>
<p>Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with historical versions of sh.  sh  does
not  treat  opening  or closing braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and
preserves them in the output.  Bash removes braces from words as a consequence of brace
expansion.  For example, a word entered to sh as file{1,2} appears identically in the output.
The same word is output as file1 file2 after expansion by bash.  If strict compatibility with
sh is  desired,  start  bash with the +B option or disable brace expansion with the +B option to
the set command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tilde-expansion">
<h3>Tilde Expansion<a class="headerlink" href="#tilde-expansion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (<a href="#id4"><span class="problematic" id="id5">`</span></a>~&#8217;), all of the characters preceding  the
first  unquoted  slash  (or  all  characters, if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a
tilde-prefix.  If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted,  the  characters  in
the  tilde-prefix  following  the  tilde are treated as a possible login name.  If this login
name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the  shell  parameter  HOME.
If  HOME is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead.
Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory associated with the specified
login name.</p>
<p>If the tilde-prefix is a <a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">`</span></a>~+&#8217;, the value of the shell variable PWD replaces the tilde-prefix.
If the tilde-prefix is a <a href="#id8"><span class="problematic" id="id9">`</span></a>~-&#8216;, the value of the shell variable OLDPWD, if it is set, is
substituted.   If  the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number N,
optionally prefixed by a <a href="#id10"><span class="problematic" id="id11">`</span></a>+&#8217; or a <a href="#id12"><span class="problematic" id="id13">`</span></a>-&#8216;, the tilde-prefix is replaced  with  the  corresponding
element  from  the directory stack, as it would be displayed by the dirs builtin invoked with
the tilde-prefix as an argument.  If the characters following the tilde in  the  tilde-prefix
consist of a number without a leading <a href="#id14"><span class="problematic" id="id15">`</span></a>+&#8217; or <a href="#id16"><span class="problematic" id="id17">`</span></a>-&#8216;, <a href="#id18"><span class="problematic" id="id19">`</span></a>+&#8217; is assumed.</p>
<p>If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is unchanged.</p>
<p>Each  variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immediately following a : or
the first =.  In these cases, tilde expansion is also performed.  Consequently, one  may  use
filenames with tildes in assignments to PATH, MAILPATH, and CDPATH, and the shell assigns the
expanded value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parameter-expansion">
<h3>Parameter Expansion<a class="headerlink" href="#parameter-expansion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="#id20"><span class="problematic" id="id21">`</span></a>$&#8217; character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic  expansion.
The  parameter  name  or  symbol  to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are
optional but serve to protect the variable to be expanded from characters immediately
following it which could be interpreted as part of the name.</p>
<p>When  braces  are used, the matching ending brace is the first <a href="#id22"><span class="problematic" id="id23">`</span></a>}&#8217; not escaped by a backslash
or within a quoted string, and not within an embedded arithmetic expansion, command
substitution, or parameter expansion.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>${parameter}</dt>
<dd>The  value  of  parameter is substituted.  The braces are required when parameter is a
positional parameter with more than one digit, or when  parameter  is  followed  by  a
character  which  is  not  to  be interpreted as part of its name.  The parameter is a
shell parameter as described above PARAMETERS) or an array reference (Arrays).</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the first character of parameter is an exclamation point (!), it  introduces  a  level  of
variable  indirection.  Bash uses the value of the variable formed from the rest of parameter
as the name of the variable; this variable is then expanded and that value  is  used  in  the
rest  of the substitution, rather than the value of parameter itself.  This is known as indirect
expansion.  The exceptions to this are the expansions  of  ${!prefix*}  and  ${!name[&#64;]}
described  below.   The  exclamation point must immediately follow the left brace in order to
introduce indirection.</p>
<p>In each of the cases below, word is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion,  command
substitution, and arithmetic expansion.</p>
<p>When  not  performing  substring expansion, using the forms documented below (e.g., :-), bash
tests for a parameter that is unset or null.  Omitting the colon results in a test only for a
parameter that is unset.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>${parameter:-word}</dt>

<dt>${parameter:=word}</dt>
<dd>Assign Default Values.  If parameter is unset  or  null,  the  expansion  of  word  is
assigned to parameter.  The value of parameter is then substituted.  Positional

<dt>${parameter:?word}</dt>
<dd>Display Error if Null or Unset.  If parameter is null or unset, the expansion of  word

below.   If  length  is  omitted,  expands  to the substring of the value of parameter
starting at the character specified by offset and extending to the end of  the  value.
length and offset are arithmetic expressions (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION below).</p>
<p>If  offset  evaluates  to  a  number less than zero, the value is used as an offset in
characters from the end of the value of parameter.  If length evaluates  to  a  number
less than zero, it is interpreted as an offset in characters from the end of the value
of parameter rather than a number of characters, and the expansion is  the  characters
between  offset  and  that result.  Note that a negative offset must be separated from
the colon by at least one space to avoid being confused with the :- expansion.</p>
<p>If parameter is &#64;, the result is length positional parameters beginning at offset.   A
negative  offset is taken relative to one greater than the greatest positional
parameter, so an offset of -1 evaluates to the last positional parameter. It is an
expansion error if length evaluates to a number less than zero.</p>
<p>If  parameter is an indexed array name subscripted by &#64; or <a href="#id26"><span class="problematic" id="id27">*</span></a>, the result is the length
members of the array beginning with ${parameter[offset]}.  A negative offset is  taken
relative  to  one  greater  than  the  maximum index of the specified array.  It is an
expansion error if length evaluates to a number less than zero.</p>
<p>Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces undefined results.</p>
<p>Substring indexing is zero-based unless the positional parameters are used,  in  which
case  the indexing starts at 1 by default.  If offset is 0, and the positional
parameters are used, $0 is prefixed to the list.</p>

<h3>Command Substitution<a class="headerlink" href="#command-substitution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Command  substitution  allows the output of a command to replace the command name.  There are
two forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>$(command)</div></blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>or</dt>
<dd><cite>command</cite></dd>
</dl>
<p>Bash performs the expansion by executing command and replacing the command substitution  with
the  standard  output  of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.  Embedded newlines
are not deleted, but they may be removed during word  splitting.   The  command  substitution
$(cat file) can be replaced by the equivalent but faster $(&lt; file).</p>
<p>When  the  old-style  backquote  form  of substitution is used, backslash retains its literal
meaning except when followed by $, <a href="#id52"><span class="problematic" id="id53">`</span></a>, or .  The first backquote not preceded by a  backslash
terminates  the command substitution.  When using the $(command) form, all characters between
the parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially.</p>
<p>Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using  the  backquoted  form,  escape  the
inner backquotes with backslashes.</p>
<p>If  the  substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and pathname expansion are
not performed on the results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="arithmetic-expansion">
<h3>Arithmetic Expansion<a class="headerlink" href="#arithmetic-expansion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and  the  substitution
of the result.  The format for arithmetic expansion is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>$((expression))</div></blockquote>
<p>The old format $[expression] is deprecated and will be removed in upcoming versions of bash.</p>
<p>The  expression  is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a double quote inside the
parentheses is not treated specially.  All tokens in the  expression  undergo  parameter  and
variable  expansion,  command  substitution, and quote removal.  The result is treated as the
arithmetic expression to be evaluated.  Arithmetic expansions may be nested.</p>
<p>The evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below under ARITHMETIC  EVALUATION.
If  expression  is  invalid,  bash  prints  a  message indicating failure and no substitution
occurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="process-substitution">
<h3>Process Substitution<a class="headerlink" href="#process-substitution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Process substitution is supported on systems that support named pipes (FIFOs) or the  /dev/fd
method  of  naming open files.  It takes the form of &lt;(list) or &gt;(list).  The process list is
run with its input or output connected to a FIFO or some file in /dev/fd.  The name  of  this
file  is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion.  If the
&gt;(list) form is used, writing to the file will provide input for list.  If the  &lt;(list)  form
is used, the file passed as an argument should be read to obtain the output of list.</p>
<p>When  available, process substitution is performed simultaneously with parameter and variable
expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="word-splitting">
<h3>Word Splitting<a class="headerlink" href="#word-splitting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The shell scans the results of parameter  expansion,  command  substitution,  and  arithmetic
expansion that did not occur within double quotes for word splitting.</p>
<p>The  shell  treats  each character of IFS as a delimiter, and splits the results of the other
expansions into words using these characters as field terminators.  If IFS is unset,  or  its
value  is  exactly  &lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;, the default, then sequences of &lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt;, and
&lt;newline&gt; at the beginning and end of the results of the previous expansions are ignored, and
any  sequence  of IFS characters not at the beginning or end serves to delimit words.  If IFS
has a value other than the default, then sequences of the whitespace characters space and tab
are  ignored  at the beginning and end of the word, as long as the whitespace character is in
the value of IFS (an IFS whitespace character). Any character in IFS that is not IFS
whitespace, along with any adjacent IFS whitespace characters, delimits a field. A sequence of
IFS whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter. If the value of IFS is null, no
word splitting occurs.</p>
<p>Explicit null arguments (&#8220;&#8221; or &#8216;&#8217;) are retained.  Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting
from the expansion of parameters that have no values, are removed. If a parameter with no
value is expanded within double quotes, a null argument results and is retained.</p>
<p>Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pathname-expansion">
<h3>Pathname Expansion<a class="headerlink" href="#pathname-expansion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After word splitting, unless the -f option has been set, bash scans each word for the
characters <a href="#id54"><span class="problematic" id="id55">*</span></a>, ?, and [.  If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a
pattern, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of filenames matching the pattern (see
Pattern Matching below). If no matching filenames are found, and the shell option nullglob
is not enabled, the word is left unchanged. If the nullglob option is set, and no matches
are found, the word is removed. If the failglob shell option is set, and no matches are
found,  an  error  message  is  printed and the command is not executed.  If the shell option
nocaseglob is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic
characters.   Note that when using range expressions like [a-z] (see below), letters of the other
case may be included, depending on the setting of LC_COLLATE.  When a  pattern  is  used  for
pathname  expansion,  the  character <a href="#id56"><span class="problematic" id="id57">``</span></a>.&#8217;&#8217;  at the start of a name or immediately following a
slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option dotglob is set.   When  matching  a
pathname,  the  slash character must always be matched explicitly.  In other cases, the <a href="#id58"><span class="problematic" id="id59">``</span></a>.&#8217;&#8217;
character is not treated specially.  See the description of shopt below under  SHELL  BUILTIN
COMMANDS for a description of the nocaseglob, nullglob, failglob, and dotglob shell options.</p>
<p>The  GLOBIGNORE  shell  variable may be used to restrict the set of filenames matching a pattern.
If GLOBIGNORE is set, each matching filename that also matches one of the patterns  in
GLOBIGNORE  is removed from the list of matches.  The filenames <a href="#id60"><span class="problematic" id="id61">``</span></a>.&#8217;&#8217;  and <a href="#id62"><span class="problematic" id="id63">``</span></a>..&#8217;&#8217;  are always
ignored when GLOBIGNORE is set and not null.  However, setting GLOBIGNORE to a non-null value
has  the effect of enabling the dotglob shell option, so all other filenames beginning with a
<a href="#id64"><span class="problematic" id="id65">``</span></a>.&#8217;&#8217;  will match.  To get the old behavior of ignoring filenames  beginning  with  a  <a href="#id66"><span class="problematic" id="id67">``</span></a>.&#8217;&#8216;,
make  <a href="#id68"><span class="problematic" id="id69">``</span></a>.*&#8217;&#8217;  one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE.  The dotglob option is disabled when
GLOBIGNORE is unset.</p>

<h3>Pattern Matching<a class="headerlink" href="#pattern-matching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern characters  described
below,  matches  itself.   The NUL character may not occur in a pattern.  A backslash escapes
the following character; the escaping backslash is discarded when matching.  The special
pattern characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.</p>
<p>The special pattern characters have the following meanings:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Matches  any string, including the null string.  When the globstar shell option
is enabled, and * is used in a pathname expansion context, two adjacent <a href="#id70"><span class="problematic" id="id71">*</span></a>s used
as  a single pattern will match all files and zero or more directories and sub              directories.  If followed by a /, two adjacent <a href="#id72"><span class="problematic" id="id73">*</span></a>s will match  only  directories
and subdirectories.</li>
</ul>
<p>?      Matches any single character.
[...]  Matches  any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of characters separated by</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a hyphen denotes a range expression; any character that falls between those two
characters,  inclusive, using the current locale&#8217;s collating sequence and char              acter set, is matched.  If the first character following the [ is a !  or  a  ^
then any character not enclosed is matched.  The sorting order of characters in
range expressions is determined by the current locale and  the  values  of  the
LC_COLLATE or LC_ALL shell variables, if set.  To obtain the traditional inter              pretation of range expressions, where [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd], set  value
of  the LC_ALL shell variable to C, or enable the globasciiranges shell option.
A - may be matched by including it as the first or last character in  the  set.
A ] may be matched by including it as the first character in the set.</p>
<p>Within  [ and ], character classes can be specified using the syntax [:class:],
where class is one of the following classes defined in the POSIX standard:
alnum alpha ascii blank cntrl digit graph lower print punct  space  upper  word
xdigit
A  character  class  matches  any  character belonging to that class.  The word
character class matches letters, digits, and the character _.</p>
<p>Within [ and ], an equivalence class can be specified using the  syntax  [=c=],
which  matches all characters with the same collation weight (as defined by the
current locale) as the character c.</p>
<p>Within [ and ], the syntax [.symbol.] matches the collating symbol symbol.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If the extglob shell option is enabled using the  shopt  builtin,  several  extended  pattern
matching operators are recognized.  In the following description, a pattern-list is a list of
one or more patterns separated by a <a href="#id74"><span class="problematic" id="id75">|</span></a>.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of
the following sub-patterns:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>?(pattern-list)</dt>
<dd>Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns</dd>
<dt><a href="#id76"><span class="problematic" id="id77">*</span></a>(pattern-list)</dt>
<dd>Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns</dd>
<dt>+(pattern-list)</dt>
<dd>Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns</dd>
<dt>&#64;(pattern-list)</dt>
<dd>Matches one of the given patterns</dd>
<dt>!(pattern-list)</dt>
<dd>Matches anything except one of the given patterns</dd>
</dl>
