AAltsys Development Guides
=============================

These guides provide a training resource covering essential information for the 
novice web developer. This documentation is self-referential, so a developer may 
clone this project and use it as an example of the web development process.

Understanding web application development means understanding the technologies 
which underpin the web. Others may argue this point, but web applications are 
written in interpreted languages such as Ruby, PhP, Python, or maybe Java. Web 
servers such as Apache and nginx running on some version of Linux serve the vast 
majority of all page views on the web. 

AAltsys Development Guides are intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive. Each 
guide focuses on specific solutions to general development issues, using leading 
edge technology as of about 2014. Readers in the future may find these guides 
laughable, but today they are a good introduction to the high-demand careers of 
the day.

The guides provided here are:

#. **Cloud Development:** A tour of publishing to the web using nothing more 
   than the HTML5 browser already installed on your computer, along with a bunch 
   of free cloud services.
#. **Linux Commands:** Linux commands which will impress you associates, or 
   otherwise can be used to get things done on servers and cloud services.
#. **Bash Syntax:** A reference and usage guide for the Linux command 
   interpreter, intended to make the user effective but not expert.
#. **ReST Publishing:** A tour of publishing to the web from a Linux desktop, 
   demonstrating that Linux provides everyone with the tools to be a developer.
#. **ReST Documents:** Documentation of the documentation scripting language 
   ReStructured Text, of which this document is an example.
#. **HTML / CSS:** A guide to features for viewing and modifying HTMl and CSS 
   markup, particularly is used in ReST documents.
#. **Ruby on Rails:** A workbook-style guide to learning basic Ruby, and a tour 
   of the Rails development framework, and an explanation of unit testing.
#. **Javascript:** A guide to basic Javascript, examples of JS libraries, and 
   an explanation of functional testing of browser actions.
#. **Deployment:** An explanation of how to build a web server or use a hosting 
   service to publish a web application.
