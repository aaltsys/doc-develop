AAltsys Web Developer Guide  
#############################

AAltsys Technology throws this guide into the face of the onslaught of videos, 
tutorials, and guides for all types of software development. Why? Every other 
developer guide is intended to convey a specific topic. On the other hand, 
AAltsys Technology seeks to introduce software development as a process which 
uses many tools at once in a methodical way.

"A poor workman blames his tools," it is said. The good workman, on the other 
hand, respects his tools and uses them appropriately in combination to complete 
his work. The Internet does not need separate guides for using a screwdriver 
and a hammer. Likewise, a software development guide needs to cover a range of 
technologies and methodologies to train effective developers.
