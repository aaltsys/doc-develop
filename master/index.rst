AAltsys Technology Web Development Guide
============================================

"A poor workman blames his tools," it is said. The good workman, on the other 
hand, respects his tools and uses them appropriately in combination to complete 
his work. 

AAltsys Technology throws this guide into the face of the onslaught of videos  
and tutorials regarding software development on the Internet. Why?
A carpenter does not need separate guides for using a screwdriver and a hammer.  
Yet guides for using specific programming tools are plentiful, while tutorials 
on the practices for becoming a software developer are lacking. These AAltsys 
guides cover methods and techniques of collaborative web development. Specific 
technologies are covered only after methods are introduced, when the processes 
of development are already mastered.
